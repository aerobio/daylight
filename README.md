# daylight: A Daylight Wasting Time calculator

The EU has recently decided to stop using the infamous "Daylight Savings Time" and, in the near future,
countries in the EU will no longer change the time back and forth every year.

However, each country must decide what time to use from now on. Would citicens prefer winter time for the whole year,
or they would rather choose summer time?

I've witnessed lots of discussions dominated by lack of objectivity, like saying they enjoy summer time better,
while nobody has yet experienced summer time in winter.

So I've decided to define a way to measure the impact of each option on citizen's daily lives.

This is an ongoing project. Stay tuned.
